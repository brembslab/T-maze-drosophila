# T-maze-drosophila
This is a script for plotting the results from T-maze experiments in Drosophila melanogaster tested twice


It just needs as input a csv file with a with the data ordered in this way:

- 1st column with the name Fly.line
- 2nd, 3rd and 4th columns with the number of flies in the tube illuminated by red, in the elevator and in the dark tube respectively
- 5th to 7th columns with the repetition of the experiments of the same group of flies in the same order (red, elevator, dark).

The name of the columns is only relevant in the case of Fly.line
